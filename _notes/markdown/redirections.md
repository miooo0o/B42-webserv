# Basic Steps to Implement HTTP Redirection in Your Web Server

    Parse the Incoming HTTP Request – Identify the requested route.
    Check If the Route Needs Redirection – Compare it against predefined redirection rules.
    Send an HTTP Response with a Redirect Status Code – Use 301 for permanent or 302 for temporary redirection.
    Include a Location Header – This tells the client where to go next.

## Key steps in Redirection 

    - Listens on port 8080.
    - Reads incoming HTTP requests.
    - Checks if the requested path is in the **redirect dictionary**.
    
    if in redirect dictionary
        sends an HTTP 301 response with a Location header for redirection
    else
        returns a normal response if no redirection is needed.

## Redirection Status Codes
| Code | Meaning | Use | Case |
|------|---------|-----|------|
| 301 | Moved Permanently | SEO-friendly, use when URLs change permanently. |
| 302 | Found (Temporary) | Use for temporary moves. |
| 307 | Temporary Redirect | Similar to 302 but maintains the original HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.). |
| 308 | Permanent Redirect | Like 301 but keeps the original method. |


URI redirection can introduce several security, usability, and SEO concerns. Here are some of the key potential issues:
1. Security Risks

    Open Redirects: Attackers can exploit improperly validated redirects to send users to malicious sites (e.g., phishing attacks).
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Some redirection mechanisms may allow injection of malicious scripts.
    Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: If redirections aren't secured (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS), attackers can intercept traffic and modify requests.

2. SEO & Website Performance Issues

    Link Juice Dilution: Improper redirects (like 302 instead of 301) may not transfer SEO value correctly.
    Redirect Chains & Loops: Excessive redirects can slow down page loading and negatively impact user experience and search rankings.
    Cloaking: If different users (e.g., search engines vs. real users) get redirected differently, it may be seen as deceptive and penalized by search engines.

3. Usability Issues

    Unexpected User Experience: Users may not expect to be redirected and might lose trust in a site.
    Broken Links: Redirects that aren’t properly maintained can lead to broken pages or infinite loops.
    Session & Authentication Issues: Redirects can sometimes strip session tokens, causing authentication failures.

4. Compliance & Privacy Issues

    Referrer Leaks: Redirections may expose user data if URLs contain sensitive information.
    Data Leakage: If redirect URLs include personally identifiable information (PII), it can lead to privacy violations (e.g., GDPR non-compliance).

Mitigation Strategies

    Validate all redirect URLs to prevent open redirects.
    Use proper HTTP status codes (301 for permanent, 302/307 for temporary).
    Implement HTTPS to prevent interception.
    Limit the number of chained redirects.
    Regularly audit and monitor redirections for anomalies.
