# SEMANTICS RFC9110

- Uses Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of [RFC5234]
- Extended with the notation for case-sensitivity in strings defined in [RFC7405].
- Uses a list extension
- defined in Section 5.6.1
    - allows for compact definition of comma-separated lists using a "#" operator 
- [Appendix A](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#collected.abnf)
    - shows the collected grammar with all list operators expanded to standard ABNF notation.

- [ Section 5.6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#fields.components) defines some generic syntactic components for field values.
- This specification uses the terms "character", "character encoding scheme", "charset", and "protocol element" as they are defined i  [RFC6365](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6365)  

- "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) [RFC8174](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174)

- An implementation is considered conformant if it complies with all of the requirements associated with the roles it partakes in HTTP.  
- A sender MUST NOT generate protocol elements that do not match the grammar defined by the corresponding ABNF rules.
- Within a given message, a sender MUST NOT generate protocol elements or syntax alternatives that are only allowed to be generated by - participants in other roles (i.e., a role that the sender does not have for that message).  

 - Conformance to HTTP 
    - includes both conformance to the particular messaging syntax of the protocol version in use
    - conformance to the semantics of protocol elements sent

- Length Requirements
      - A recipient SHOULD parse a received protocol element defensively, with only marginal expectations that the element will conform to its ABNF grammar and fit within a reasonable buffer size.  
      - HTTP does not have specific length limitations for many of its protocol elements because the lengths that might be appropriate will vary widely, depending on the deployment context and purpose of the implementation.
        - interoperability between senders and recipients depends on shared expectations regarding what is a reasonable length for each protocol element.
    - As minimum, a recipient MUST be able to parse and process protocol element lengths that are at least as long as the values that it generates for those same protocol elements in other messages. 
        - For example, an origin server that publishes very long URI references to its own resources needs to be able to parse and process those same references when received as a target URI.  

- Error Handling
    - A recipient MUST interpret a received protocol element according to the semantics defined for it by this specification, including extensions to this specification, unless the recipient has determined (through experience or configuration) that the sender incorrectly implements what is implied by those semantics.  

     - a recipient MAY attempt to recover a usable protocol element from an invalid construct    

- Protocol Version
    - HTTP's version number indicates the highest minor version within that major version to which the sender is conformant
        - two decimal digits separated by a "."
        - first digit = major version
        - second digit = minor version (when not provided, default = 0)

    - Major number change : incompatible syntax introduced
    - Minor number change : semantics changed, or capabilities extended

## Core Concepts
- Resources
    - HTTP request target is called a "resource"
    - This resource is an interface that can be used to interact with any types of resources
    - HTTP relies upon the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) standard [URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) to indicate the target resource [Section 7.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#target.resource) and relationships between resources

- Represenation
    - A "representation" is information that is intended to reflect a past, current, or desired state of a given resource, in a format that can be readily communicated via the protocol
    - A representation consists of a set of representation metadata and a potentially unbounded stream of representation data
