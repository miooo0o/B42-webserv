FIGURE OUT HOST/USER ISSUE

Testing Error Messages (OK but error numbers/messages are not accurate)
Testing percent coding conversion (LOOKS OK BUT HOST APPEARING IN USER)
Testing unicode validation (LOOKS OK BUT HOST APPEARING IN USER)

Method Validation : Deal with no path case

Request Line : Deal with double spaces in request line string

Make character sets accurate

Remove pass field?

Finish validation of URI

split query into pairs

move UTF-8 check to after header parsing (as encoding should be confirmed in headers)?

add header parsing

add body parsing

design server parser order : 
    read request line (check for \n or character limit)
    instantiate request - parse and validate request line
    if critical_error
        return response
    read headers
    call Request::header_parsing function - parse and validate headers
    if critical_error
        return response
    read body based on header: content-length
    call Request::body_parsing function - parse and validate body
    if critical_error
        return response
    requestHandler(request)
    response(requestHandler)

For Mina : 
Look at UTF encoding and decoding class
Look at shared error class and macro manipulation
Logging class (perhaps different levels of logging: VERBOSE (i.e. include parsing/validation of each message))
