FIGURE OUT HOST/USER ISSUE

Testing Error Messages (OK but error numbers/messages are not accurate)
Testing percent coding conversion (LOOKS OK BUT HOST APPEARING IN USER)
Testing unicode validation (LOOKS OK BUT HOST APPEARING IN USER)

Make character sets accurate

Need to remove unnecessary code - e.g. setting enums that have been replaced by errors
Remove pass field?

Finish validation of URI

split query into pairs
move UTF-8 check to after header parsing (as encoding should be confirmed in headers)?

add header parsing
add body parsing

Clean up code - split into other classes/subclasses?

design server parser order : 
    read request line (check for \n or character limit)
    instantiate request - parse and validate request line
    if critical_error
        return response
    read headers
    call Request::header_parsing function - parse and validate headers
    if critical_error
        return response
    read body based on header: content-length
    call Request::body_parsing function - parse and validate body
    if critical_error
        return response
    requestHandler(request)
    response(requestHandler)
