Testing Error Messages
Testing percent coding conversion
Testing unicode validation

Make character sets accurate
Make error numbers/messages accurate

Need to remove unnecessary code - e.g. setting enums that have been replaced by errors
Remove pass field?

Finish validation of URI

split query into pairs
move UTF-8 check to after header parsing (as encoding should be confirmed in headers)?

add header parsing
add body parsing

Clean up code - split into other classes/subclasses?

design server parser order : 
    read request line (check for \n or character limit)
    instantiate request - parse and validate request line
    if critical_error
        return response
    read headers
    call Request::header_parsing function - parse and validate headers
    if critical_error
        return response
    read body based on header: content-length
    call Request::body_parsing function - parse and validate body
    if critical_error
        return response
    requestHandler(request)
    response(requestHandler)
