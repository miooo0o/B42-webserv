Priorities
++++++++++
Read Mina's code
Read Damian's code?

To be designed
++++++++++++++
Server side 

To be added
+++++++++++
Add Body Parsing
Add proper Unit Testing
Server Path processing - need to decide on endpoint matching criteria

To Be Fixed
++++++++++++
Fix Header Parsing
Method Validation : Deal with no path case
Request Line : Deal with double spaces in request line string
Make character sets accurate
Remove pass field?
Move UTF-8 check to after header parsing (as encoding should be confirmed in headers)?

To be finished
++++++++++++++
Finish Request Line Validation
Finish validation of URI
Finish Header Validation
Finish parsing and validation
Finish class creation - find a coherent approach for all classes
split query into pairs

Testing
++++++++
Request Line Testing (Method, URI (Path, Query etc), Version)
Percent Code Testing
Header Parsing Testing
Body Parsing Testing(Chunked, PlainText)
Error Testing
Log Testing

design server parser order :
    read request line (check for \n or character limit)
    instantiate request - parse and validate request line
    if critical_error
        return response
    read headers
    call Request::header_parsing function - parse and validate headers
    if critical_error
        return response
    read body based on header: content-length
    call Request::body_parsing function - parse and validate body
    if critical_error
        return response
    requestHandler(request)
    response(requestHandler)

For Mina : 
Look at UTF encoding and decoding class
Look at shared error class and macro manipulation
Logging class (perhaps different levels of logging: VERBOSE (i.e. include parsing/validation of each message))
